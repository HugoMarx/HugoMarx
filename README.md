## Hi there 👋

I'm Hugo

These days, I mostly work with Symfony and Go, with a strong interest in software craftsmanship and DevOps practices.

When I'm not fixing bugs or contributing to open source, I'm probably exploring new technologies and continuously learning something new.

Feel free to reach out — always happy to connect 🚀
